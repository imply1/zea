# Unit 1: Primitive Types

This unit introduces students to the basics of programming in Java, focusing on the use of variables and operatorsfor storing and manipulating primitive data.

## Duration
 * 2 Weeks

## Unit Topics
 * User input and output
 * Variables
 * Data types
 * Calculations using int and double values
 * Modular division
 * Numeric casting

## Lessons
 * [Unit 1: Lesson 1 - Output In Java:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit1/lesson1) ​This lesson demonstrates the system.out.print and system.out.printlncommands to print text (​MOD​).
 * [Unit 1: Lesson 2 - User Input and Variables:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit1/lesson2) ​In this lesson, students learn how to store data in variables tobe accessed again later (​VAR​).
 * [Unit 1: Lesson 3 - Data Types:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit1/lesson3) ​This lesson describes different primitive data types that can be used tostore numbers in Java (​VAR​).
 * [Unit 1: Lesson 4 - Number Calculations:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit1/lesson4) ​This lesson introduces arithmetic operators and shows how toperform calculations in Java (​CON​).
 * [Unit 1: Lesson 5 - Modular Division:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit1/lesson5) ​This lesson explains how modular divisions can be calculated in Java (​CON​).
 * [Unit 1: Lesson 6 - Numeric Casts:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit1/lesson6) ​This lesson introduces casting to convert one data type to another (​CON​).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
 * Students will complete a partial line of code (​Skill 1.B​)
 * Students will determine the results of printing an expression concatenating two strings (​Skill 2.A​).
 * Students will explain why a given line of code is incorrect (​Skill 5.B​)
 * Students will find an alternative expression which gives the same results in a code segment (​Skill 4.C​).
 * Students will determine the results of running a section of code with multiple unary and assignmentoperators (​Skill 2.B​).
 * Students will design a program to individually print out the digits of a three-digit number (​Skill 1.A​).
 * Students will determine the result of casting a number (​Skill 2.A​).

## Assignment
 * [Assignment 1: Movie Ratings:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/blob/master/unit1/U1_Assignment.java) ​Students will write code using arithmetic operators and variable assignment correctly to calculate values required by the assignment specification (​Skill 2.A​). They willneed to fix any errors which occur in their code before submitting it (​Skill 4.B​).
 
## Assessments
 * Unit 1 Quiz
 * Unit 1 Exam
