# Unit 5: Writing Classes
This unit introduces the concepts required for students to write their own classes, which will form the basis for creating more sophisticated programs later in the course. This unit also contains the first of two lessons examining the wider impacts of computer science on society and culture.

## Duration
 * 4 Weeks
 
## Unit Topics
 * Void and Return methods
 * Parameters
 * Classes
 * Constructors
 * Static vs. Instance
 * Wider Impacts of Computing
## Lessons
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 1 - Void methods:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson1) This lesson explains how code can be written in methods which can then be called from the main code (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 2 - Parameters:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson2) In this lesson, students are shown how to write methods which use parameters to send information with a method call (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 3 - Parameters - Primitive vs. Class:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson3) This lesson explains how parameters of primitive and class-type data are passed to methods when they are called (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 4 - Return Methods:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson4) This lesson introduces the use of return statements to allow methods to send information back when they are called (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 5 - Classes - The Basics:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson5) Through this lesson, students are introduced to the basics of custom class creation, including writing constructors and instance methods/variables (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 6 - Constructors:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson6) This lesson shows in greater depth how constructors can be written to set the initial state of an object, and explains how formal parameters and local variables differ from global variables in scope (MOD, VAR).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 7 - Documenting a Class:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson7) In this lesson students learn how to write comments to document a class, including using preconditions and postconditions (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 8 - Static Vs. Instance:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson8) This lesson covers the static modifier which can be used to associate variables or methods to a class rather than with an object (MOD).
 * [Unit 5: Lesson 9 - Wider Impacts of Computing:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit5/lesson9) For this lesson, students must conduct research into aspects of the ethical and social implications of computing systems (IOC).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
 * Students will determine what is printed by a method that uses selection (Skill 2.B).
 * Students will write a method which uses selection to meet a specification for what will be printed (Skill 3.C).
 * Students will determine what is output by a code segment which calls a method (Skill 2.C).
 * Students will write a method using iteration and selection which returns values according to a specification (Skill 3.C).
 * Students will create a custom class, which is used to create objects representing vehicles (Skill 3.B).
 
 ## Assignment
  * [Assignment 5: Fraction:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/blob/master/unit5/U5_Assignment.java) Students will write the constructors and methods of a class designed to represent fractions (Skill 3.B). They will need to write the class methods according to strict specifications as to how the methods should behave for different values of parameters and/or member variables (Skill 3.C).
  
 ## Assessments
  * Unit 5 Quiz
  * Unit 5 Exam
