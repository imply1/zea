# Unit 7: ArrayList
This unit introduces the concept of ArrayLists, along with some common search and sort algorithms. This unit also contains the second lesson examining the wider impacts of computer science, with an emphasis on data collection.

## Duration
* 3 Weeks

## Unit Topics
* ArrayList
* Using the For-Each loop with ArrayLists
* Linear search
* Selection & Insertion sort
* Wider impacts of data collection

## Lessons
* [Unit 7: Lesson 1 - ArrayList:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson1) This lesson explains what an ArrayList is, and the advantages to using an ArrayList (VAR).
* [Unit 7: Lesson 2 - Traversing ArrayLists:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson2) This lesson describes how to traverse ArrayLists using both for-loops and for-each loops, including introducing some algorithms which add or remove items (VAR, CON).
* [Unit 7: Lesson 3 - Array Algorithms with ArrayLists:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson3) This lesson demonstrates how standard algorithms developed for arrays can also be applied to work with ArrayList structures (CON).
* [Unit 7: Lesson 4 - Linear Search:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson4) This lesson describes the theory of a linear/sequential search algorithm, and also shows how this is implemented for an ArrayList (CON).
* [Unit 7: Lesson 5 - Selection Sort:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson5) The selection sort algorithm, used to order data in an array, ArrayList or similar structure, is described in this lesson (CON).
* [Unit 7: Lesson 6 - Insertion Sort:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson6) A second algorithm for sorting data, the insertion sort, is introduced in this lesson (CON).
* [Unit 7: Lesson 7 - Wider Impacts of Data Collection:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/lesson7) In this lesson, students explore the risks to privacy of storing personal data using computer systems (IOC).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
* Students will write code which creates and then manipulates the contents of an ArrayList (Skill 3.D).
* Students will determine the output of a code segment which makes multiple calls to ArrayList and String methods (Skill 2.C).
* Students will write a method according to exact specifications given (Skill 3.C).
* Students will create a method which implements a selection sort algorithm: manipulating an ArrayList by changing the order of its values (Skill 3.D).
* Students will work out the value of a variable by determining the number of times a particular statement runs in a method call (Skill 2.D).

## Assignment
* [Assignment 7: Game Wheel:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit7/U7_Assignment) Students will write a private method in a partially completed “GameWheel” class which interacts with the other methods and variables of this class as well as a separate class “Slice” which is provided (Skill 1.C). This traverses an ArrayList of objects and changes their order (Skill 3.D).

## Assessments and Labs
* Unit 7 Quiz
* Unit 7 Exam
* Lab: Data Lab
