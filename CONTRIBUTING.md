Hi! If you want to contribute to this repository, just open up a pull request. However, there are a couple requirements.
* Make sure it is correct and functions.
* Describe the pull request in the simplest way possible (ie: adding U1L6Q3 & correcting U7L4Q1).
* If it works, leave it. Only open a request if you are fixing something or adding a new lesson.  


After that, I'll take a look at what you've contributed and count it in!
