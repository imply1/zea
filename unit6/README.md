# Unit 6: Array
This unit introduces the array data structure which can be used to hold multiple primitive values or object references. Students will learn how to write code which traverses an array to search for or manipulate data in thearray.

## Duration
* 3 Weeks

## Unit Topics
* One-dimensional arrays
* Algorithms for arrays, search algorithms
* Arrays of Strings
* The for-each loop
## Lessons
* [Unit 6: Lesson 1 - One-Dimensional Arrays:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit6/lesson1) This lesson introduces the array data type and explains how
to access and change the elements of an array (VAR).
* [Unit 6: Lesson 2 - Algorithms – Searching:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit6/lesson2) This lesson demonstrates how an array can be traversed and
showcases some standard algorithms which can be used with arrays (VAR, CON).
* [Unit 6: Lesson 3 - Arrays of Strings:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit6/lesson3) This lesson introduces arrays of class data types, focusing on the use of arrays of String objects (VAR).
* [Unit 6: Lesson 4 - Algorithms on Arrays:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit6/lesson4) This lesson introduces algorithms which change the contents of arrays by changing the position of elements as well as adding and removing elements (CON).
* [Unit 6: Lesson 5 - The For-Each Loop:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit6/lesson5) This lesson introduces students to the for-each loop (also called the enhanced for loop) which is used to traverse arrays (VAR).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
* Students will determine the results of executing a block of code with multiple operators working on array elements (Skill 2.B).
* Students will determine code needed to complete a partially created code segment (Skill 1.B).
* Students will write code which traverses an array and returns information about its contents (Skill 3.D).
* Students will describe the effect of changing an existing segment of code (Skill 5.C).
* Students will write a method which traverses an array and changes the value of its elements by inserting an element (Skill 3.D).
* Students will determine the output of a code segment with multiple method calls (Skill 2.C).

## Assignment
* [Assignment 6: Array Statistics:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit6/U6_Assignment) Students will write code which creates an array, and then traverses this array to initialize its values and determine certain features (Skill 3.D).

## Assessments
* Unit 6 Quiz
* Unit 6 Exam
