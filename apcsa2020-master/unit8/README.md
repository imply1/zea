# Unit 8: 2-D Arrays

This unit introduces the concept of 2-D arrays, along with some algorithms that can be used in conjunction with 2-D arrays.

## Duration
* 2 Weeks

## Unit Topics
* 2-D Arrays and Algorithms

## Lessons
* [Unit 8: Lesson 1 - 2-D Arrays:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit8/lesson1) This lesson covers the fundamentals of how data is stored and accessed in a 2-D array (VAR).
* [Unit 8: Lesson 2 - 2-D Array Algorithms:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit8/lesson2) This lesson introduces common algorithms for 2-D arrays, including applying algorithms which were initially defined for 1-D arrays (CON).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
* Students will complete a partially completed code segment by determining a correct condition to use (Skill 1.B).
* Students will write a method which is used to create a 2-D array and traverse it to edit the values stored to desired results (Skill 3.E).
* Students will trace code which traverses a 2-D array and determine what output is when the code is executed (Skill 2.B).

## Assignment
* Assignment 8: Battleship: Students will write methods which traverse a 2-D array, representing a board in a battleship game. The methods will change values in the array as well as returning values to determine features of the board (Skill 3.E).

## Assessments and Labs
* Unit 8 Quiz
* Unit 8 Exam
* Lab: Steganography
