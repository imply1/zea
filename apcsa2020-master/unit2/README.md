# Unit 2: Using Objects

This unit introduces the use of classes, methods and objects.

## Duration
 * 4 Weeks
 
## Unit Topics
 * Primitive vs. class data types
 * Computer memory and storage
 * String functions and concatenation
 * Constructors, classes and objects
 * Void and non-void methods
 * Wrapper classes
 * The Math class

## Lessons
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 1 - Strings and Class Types:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson1) ​Through the specific example of the String data type, thislesson explains how reference data is stored in memory (​VAR​).
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 2 - Escape characters and String Concatenation:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson2) ​This lesson explains how to use escapecharacters in String literals, and more about concatenating String variables with primitives (​VAR​)
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 3 - String Functions:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson3) ​This lesson introduces methods which can be called on objects of theString data type (​VAR​).
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 4 - Classes and Objects:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson4) ​This lesson explains the class-object structure found in Java(​MOD​).
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 5 - Using Constructors:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson5) ​In this lesson students are introduced to new classes they canimport, and use constructors for creating objects of these class types (​MOD​).
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 6 - Using Methods:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson6) ​This lesson explains how to call methods on objects in Java, and alsointroduces API documentation which is used to determine which methods can be used for a variable of agiven class (​MOD, VAR​).
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 7 - Wrapper Classes:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson7) ​This lesson discusses wrapper classes and explains the processesof autoboxing and unboxing to convert between wrapper class-type variables and primitives (​VAR​).
 * [Unit 2: Lesson 8 - Math Functions:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit2/lesson8) ​This lesson introduces the static methods from the Math class, used for further mathematical calculations in Java code (​CON​).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
 * Students will determine the output of a statement with multiple different operators used (​Skill 2.A​).
 * Students will determine the result of executing a line of code containing multiple method calls (​Skill 2.C​).
 * Students will use methods to take user input, then create objects based upon the input (​Skill 3.A​).
 * Students will choose a code segment to change the state of an object which is declared in the question text (​Skill 1.C​)
 * Students will write code which creates objects, then call methods to both determine and change the stateof the object (​Skill 3.A​).
 * Students will explain why a line of code is incorrect (​Skill 5.B​).

## Assignment
 * [Assignment 2: Control Tower:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/blob/master/unit2/U2_Assignment.java) ​Students will use the constructors of a new class type to create objects,and call methods on the objects created to both change and access their states (​Skill 3.A​).

## Assessments
 * Unit 2 Quiz
 * Unit 2 Exam
